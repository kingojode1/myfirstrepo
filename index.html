            <h3>ARE YOU ABOVE 18?</h3>
            <P>If you want to go into betting, you should be mentally and financially ready for the task at hand and the one you are most likely going to face in the future becuase  being a punter is quite a tricky thing to get involved in. Most times, maturity comes with age, but this is not to suggest that only the aged are mature. I want to claim a disclaimer here! we advise that punters should be mature enough to know when to stop being a punter and when to continue to be a punter, and this is when maturity comes into play. If you feel that you are no longer getting the result you expected when you started off, then take some time off.</P>

        <div class="warnings">
            <h3>DON'T PUT IN ALL YOUR SAVINGS.</h3>
            <p>Putting in all your savings into betting is asking for more than you will be able to handle. Nobody tests the depth of water with both feet. What if the water is quite deep and you will not be able to get back to dry land again. There are several things you have to put into consideration before you go into punting, and one of such things is to remember that you are going into prediction and something that has to do with human behaviour. And those who study human  behaviour will end up telling you human beings are social animals. Consequently, humans can change at any given time. So bet wisely.</p>

            <h3>IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT.</h3>
            <p>When you have found a winning formular, do not easily discard it. This is because what keeps working for you has a pattern and should not be jettisoned as long as it is stiil functioning effectively. When you have discovered a winning formular,  the best thing to do is to even try as much as possible to hit them hard at that point in time before you will discover that the strategy is no longer working.</p>
